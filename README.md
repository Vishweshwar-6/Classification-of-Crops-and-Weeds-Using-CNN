# Classification-of-Crops-and-Weeds-Using-CNN

## Project Description

Here is the product aimed on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately classify crops and weeds from agricultural field images. The goal is to assist in automating the process of distinguishing between crop plants and weeds, which is crucial for precision agriculture. By leveraging image recognition techniques through deep learning, the model can help farmers identify and remove weeds efficiently, leading to improved crop yield and reduced use of herbicides.

The CNN model is trained on a dataset of labeled images containing crops and weeds (The dataset can be accessed through the file named "agriculture". The dataset is labelled as "plants" for crop images and "weeds" for weed images. Further they are split into two categories Trian and Test.) 
It processes the images by extracting spatial features at multiple layers and classifies the input into either the "crop" or "weed" category. 
The model aims to achieve high accuracy while being scalable for real-time application in agricultural settings.
